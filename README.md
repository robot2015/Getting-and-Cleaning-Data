This function will merge the training and the test sets from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) to create one data set. It will extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. Output is a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  A description of the parameters is in "Code Book.txt".
